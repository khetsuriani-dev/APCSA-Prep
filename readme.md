## My AP CS A prep

This is a repository where I upload everything I write for AP CS A exam preparation. I will usually upload codeforces problem solutions and my little projects.

## Navigation

There are 3 main folders for now.
```
├───codeforces -- Where I wil upload my codeforces solutions
├───projects -- My projects
└───studying -- Just testing out new stuff I learn
```

I started learning java on September 1.
